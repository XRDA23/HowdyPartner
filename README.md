An AR experience of the boardgame [Partners](https://www.partnersboardgame.com/) with visual accessibility augmenteded pawns for the color blind. The project future is adding more board prefabs to accommodate different numbers of players without having to purchase a new physical board.
An SVG of a class diagram used in development can be found in the repository along with the source code.
Created as a course assignment in AR for XR development in autumn of 2023 for software engineering at [VIA university college](https://via.dk), campus Horsens, DK.
